# Twitter Detox

Makes Twitter more bearable, i.e. removes the Trending, User Suggestions, Contact Import, and Advertise on Twitter modules of the old Twitter style. I did not test this on the new Twitter style.

## Current version

1.0.0

## Getting Started

[![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](MY.USER.CSS)

You will need a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS stylesheets. I use **Stylus** ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/)).

### Installing

To install, with a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS stylesheets, open the raw file within the browser.
