**Twitter Detox** is a user stylesheet that makes the Twitter website more bearable, i.e. removes the entire right sidebar of the new Twitter style, which contains the Search Form\*, Trending, User Suggestions, Contact Import, and Advertise on Twitter modules.

\* Should you need to use the search form, it's also available in the _Explore_ section, at the very top.

## Getting Started

### TL;DR

[![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nyxmidnight/twitter-detox/master/twitter-detox.user.css)

### Prerequisites

This is a **user stylesheet** that gets applied to a website thanks to a **userstyle manager extension** installed in your browser. (In other words, this will not work on the Twitter **app**.) You will need a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS stylesheets. I personally use **Stylus** (for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), for [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/)).

### Installation

1.  Using a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS stylesheets (see **Prerequisites**), open the raw file within the browser by clicking on the next link.
    :package: [Install the userCSS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nyxmidnight/twitter-detox/master/twitter-detox.user.css)

2.  The userstyle manager will open the stylesheet. The sidebar on the left will have an **Install Style** button to install the user style. Below is a checkbox to receive updates. Leave it checked to automatically receive the updated stylesheet whenever I make changes because Twitter changed their code and broke the stylesheet.
3.  Press the **Install Style** button to install the user style in your browser.
4.  Reload your Twitter timeline and enjoy the peace and quiet!

## Technical details

### Versioning

I use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for versioning. To summarize: each version is numbered according to a (major).(minor).(patch) numbering scheme. If the (patch) number goes up, that's a backward compatible bug fix. If the (minor) patch number goes up, that's a backward compatible new function added. If the (major) number goes up, that's a whole new version that is not backward compatible.

Feel free to fork the repo or download the stylesheet and mess with it at your leisure!
