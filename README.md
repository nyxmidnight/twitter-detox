# ⛔ DEPRECATED ⛔ Twitter Detox

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

Since the change to Xitter, my stylesheet does not work anymore, but I don't use Twitter much anymore either, so I decided to stop maintaining this stylesheet. It will remain here as an archive.

If you're looking for a way to make Xitter bearable, check out the browser extension [**Control Panel for Twitter**](https://github.com/insin/control-panel-for-twitter).

**Twitter Detox** was a user stylesheet that made the Twitter desktop website more bearable by removing the entire right sidebar of the new (pre-X) Twitter style.
